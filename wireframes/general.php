        <p class="deck-copy">Welcome to the Emergency Department (ED) at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Our mission is to provide the best care for your child as quickly as possible. Specially trained nurses and doctors are available 24 hours a day to care for children with medical problems that cannot wait to be seen by their regular doctor. We know that it can be stressful to have a sick child and we will do everything we can to help families and their children during their emergency department visit.</p>
        <p>An attending physician, board certified in pediatric emergency medicine, is in The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's Emergency Department (ED) 24 hours a day to handle emergencies, unscheduled visits and consultations that need immediate attention.</p>
        <p>The Emergency Department provides care for close to 90,000 patients a year. It was the first Level 1 <a href="#">Trauma Center</a> for children in the Delaware Valley and is home to the <a href="#">Poison Control Center</a>, and we were named <a href="#">number one in the nation for emergency medical care</a> by <em>Parents Magazine</em>.</p>
        <p>Non-urgent patients are triaged to a separate area within the ED during evenings and weekends. Ambulance transport from another hospital and other referrals may be arranged by calling The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia's <a href="#">Emergency Transport Service</a> at <a href="tel://1-215-590-2160">215-590-2160</a> or <a href="tel://1-800-590-2160">1-800-590-2160</a>.</p>
        <p>Referring physicians are encouraged to call the Division's referral line, <a href="tel://1-888-335-4371">1-888-EDKIDS1</a> <a href="tel://1-888-335-4371">(1-888-335-4371)</a>, to provide information about their patients and to leave a contact number at which they can be reached after the patient has been evaluated.</p>
